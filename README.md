# Attendance-Management-System
this is my first management system with html,css,php and mysql.
<br>
here one teacher can log in to the system and do these :
<br>
<ol type="1">
  <li>take attendance based on batch, course and date (can re take attendace) </li>
  <li>see attendance based on batch, course and date </li>
  <li>add new student </li>
  <li>add batch </li>
  <li>add course </li>
  <li>assign students to the batches(if he dosen't assign student to the batch he can not take the attendance)</li>
</ol>
